**atom-generate-default-options-specs** is a package i wrote for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/).  
It generates the default options tests using `ctrl-alt-k`.

There are also general settings :

* specFileName : a string that is the file name of the generated spec file, default is `./spec/generated-default-options-spec.coffee`

Please note that you might need to refresh your Atom application for your settings changes to take effect.
